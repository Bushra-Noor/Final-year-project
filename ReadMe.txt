To begin, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Start by installing "Xampp" on your system.
2. The project includes an "SQL" file containing the database, which needs to be uploaded to "PHPMyAdmin."
3. Here is the detailed process for this project:

   - Download and install Xampp.
   - Copy all the files from the "Horizon College" project to "user/xampp/htdocs/".
   - Launch Xampp and start both Apache and SQL services.
   - Access the "SQL" admin in Xampp.
   - In the PHPMyAdmin panel, import the "SQL" file named "fyp_college.sql."
   - After successfully importing the SQL file, visit "http://localhost/horizoncollege."

Note: Ensure that the SQL file is imported correctly, and the main folder in Xampp/htdocs is extracted.
